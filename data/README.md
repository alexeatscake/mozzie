# Data Folder

This folder contains the data and will include the following subfolders.

## `generated`

This folder is where the generated data will be stored.
It is produced by GDSiMS simulations.
For each of the sets of simulations, there will be a subfolder named after the simulation set, and inside that folder, there will be two folders:

### `params`

This contains the param files that will be passed to the executable.

### `output_files`

This is made by GDSiMS and is where it saves the output of the binary.
